              The common interest that members of the Association share is to inspire

              detracts from this purpose is subject to disciplinary action regardless of

              <span>DIMENSIONS.</span> FIFA Law 1 provides for flexible external field dimensions
              within a given maximum and minimum width and length. These
              dimensions should be adhered to for all fields used by teams under 12
              and older.
           </li>
 
            <li>
              <span>COMPETITION FIELDS.</span> Fields used within the competition program must
              be a minimum of 100 x 60 yards. Leagues, districts or associations
              participating in the state competition program that are unable to provide a
              field that meets these minimum requirements must advise the State
              Competition Board which will assign its Fields Committee to inspect the
              field and recommend to the Board whether or not a waiver of the minimum
              dimensions should be granted. Teams from leagues, districts or
              associations that are unable to provide an acceptable field may be
              required to play all their games away

                    U-6 play on a field approximately 20 X 40 yards with no penalty
                    areas. Fields for older age groups should be progressively larger.

                 <li>
                    U-8 plays on a field 40-50 yards in length and 20-30 yards width.

                        The decision for team/spectator placement on the field will
                        be made by the governing body of that team. A team’s
                        bench area shall consist of that area at least one (1) yard
                        away from the touchline and extending to twenty yards (20)
                        both ways from the halfway line. In the event that field 2

                        the field, a team’s bench area shall consist of that area two
                        (2) yards away from the touchline and extending twenty

                        to remain within their bench area during the game. Parents
                        and spectators should occupy the same side of the field as
                        the team they are supporting.

                        touchline. Each team bench area shall be located two yards
                        outside the touchline, beginning not closer than five yards
                        from midfield and extending not further than twenty yards
                        from midfield. The home team shall have the right to choose
                        the location of its bench area. Coaches and substitutes must
                        remain within their team's bench area during the game.

                        spectator declines to abide by requests from match officials

                which the offending participant would otherwise be eligible to participate.
                This process will continue so that for every third yellow card received
                during a playing year, the player will be suspended from playing in the
                next game (after the receipt of a third yellow card) for which the offending

                player pass. He shall collect the passes of those players and coaches who
                are to participate in the game. The referee must allow no player into the
                game for whom he/she has no pass.

                certification level and registration standing with the USSF to coach,
                assistant coach, or team captain of teams participating in that game. Prior
                to the game a coach may decide to postpone the game if the referees do
                not produce the requested documentation. The game is to be replayed at
